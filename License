If you drop this `README.md`, your repo will look **fully professional**, and you won’t need anything else.  

Everything else — `.env`, `.gitignore`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile` — is already perfectly clean.  

Do you want me to also suggest a **small `.gitignore`** for maximum safety? It’s just 3–4 lines.
